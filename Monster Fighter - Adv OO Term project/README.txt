This program is my final project for Advanced Object Oriented Programming - (COP4368)

This is a simple WPF/C# turn based combat game.

To easily run the game download the MonsterFighter.exe & MonsterLib.dll files to the same directory and run MonsterFighter.exe

A user manual is included to explain the game play - Monster Fighter - User Manual.pdf

The main code for the games mechanics is included in form1.cs
The librarys for classes are included in UserControl1.xaml.cs
